# Contributing to the source

Contributions are welcomed via merge requests. Contact the **WEST** developers before starting work to ensure it meshes well with the planned development direction and
standards set for the project.

## Version control

All changes in a pull request should be closely related. Multiple change sets that are loosely coupled should be proposed in separate pull requests. Use a consistent style for writing code. 

## Features

New features should be applicable to a variety of use-cases. The **WEST** developers can assist you in designing flexible interfaces.

## Testing

Add tests for all new functionality.

## Release

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), i.e. version labels have the form v`<major>`.`<minor>`.`<patch>`

 - Patch release: v0.0.0 to v0.0.1, only bug fixes
 - Minor release: v0.0.0 to v0.1.0, bug fixes and new features that maintain backwards compatibility
 - Major release: v0.0.0 to v1.0.0, bug fixes and new features that break backwards compatibility

# Contributing to the documentation

Comment complex sections of code so that other developers can understand them.
Add demonstrations of new functionality, e.g. using Jupyter notebooks.
