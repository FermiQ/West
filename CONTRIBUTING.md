# Version control

All changes in a pull request should be closely related. Multiple change sets that are loosely coupled should be proposed in separate pull requests. Use a consistent style for writing code. 

# Documentation

Add demonstrations of new functionality, e.g. using Jupyter notebooks.

# Testing
